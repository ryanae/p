                <h2>what did i learn from research and testing?</h2>
                <p>
                	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, my research and testing revealed that my initial portfolio build suffered from a lack focus in content as well as poor visual design choices. I initially wanted to build a portfolio for both my UX design work and my art work. In my competitor analysis, I noticed that some professional UX designers display their work as a gallery, with small image previews that lead to a separate about each project. As a result, I focused on building my portfolio section as a gallery, focusing on small, simple images and moving project details or full size images of art pieces to separate pages that would drop down when clicked. In terms of visual aesthetics for the rest of my portfolio, most of the style relied on colors. The content was simply set at a fixed width at the center of the page. <br><br>
                	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After conducting tests, I discovered that the gallery design worked well for my competitors who had lots of experience and polished projects to display, but not for me who only has two or three projects to display. User testing revealed it was unclear what my UX projects were about because there is no description visible without hovering over each section. One of the cognitive walkthroughs revealed that it is incredibly easy to completely overlook the art section of my portfolio, as one participant did not notice the gallery section until the very end of the test. Another cognitive walkthrough participant noted that the art section was random, had no sense of theme or direction, and lacked even the most basic details like when a piece was created. I came to the conclusion that I needed shift my design and focus on presenting a few quality pieces of work. Furthermore, I would need to adjust my visual style to enhance the content and not distract from it. <br><br>  
                	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also learned that my portfolio did a poor job of demonstrating who I am as a professional. From my competitor analysis, competitors presented themselves in easy to digest way on their landing pages, focusing on striking visuals while still being very simplistic. I tried to do the same, but it fell flat in my initial design. Cognitive walkthrough participants revealed that it was still hard to figure out who I was and what the page was about according to their first look at the page. So in terms of content, I also wanted to focus on delivering a clearer first impression, and also include more content that would reveal more about my professional experience. <br>

                <h2>How did i incorporate what i learned?</h2>
                <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To improve the focus of the portfolio, I decided to remove my art work and focus just on my UX design work. I changed the visual design of my project section to compliment a few projects rather than many projects. I changed the previews of each project so that each would occupy more individual space. Each project preview now includes screenshots of the final product and an easily visible description, rather than just a single image without text. I also included key skills I utilized during each project to provide more information at a glance; these mirror the skills I included in my about section. For the future, I plan to include more content in the individual pages that goes into detail about each of my projects. I also would like to reincorporate my art work into my portfolio, but only after giving my work more direction in the form of projects to avoid having an unfocused gallery of images.<br><br>
                    
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took inspiration from reworking my portfolio section and applied the improved visual style throughout my portfolio. I did not reuse the color scheme from my initial site design, instead opting to use only three different colors for the entire site to minimize distracting color use. I also reformatted each major section of my portfolio to make better use of visual space. I paid special attention to redesigning the header of my side, which now acts as a proper homepage. I struggled a lot trying find the best way to improve the first impression of end-users, unsure of how to present my name and a tiny blurb in a meaningful way. I decided to embrace the idea of being a fledgling designer at the start of her career, incorporating that idea into the homepage to better communicate information about myself and the site at a glance. <br><br>
                    
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am still in the process of adjusting the site's responsive design. In the future, I would like to keep improving on the visuals of my portfolio, as some areas like the contact section are lacking in comparison to the revamped sections. Furthermore, I want to incorporate more visual UI, similar to the scroll-to-section arrow buttons I included, replacing text links with actual UI buttons, for example.
